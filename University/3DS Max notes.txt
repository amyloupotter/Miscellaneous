- always work in Meters -> Customise -> Unit Setup -> Metric Meters -> System Unit Setup -> "1 Unit = 1.0 Meters"
- hold "Shift" + drag in move mode to duplicate an object
- "S" to snap, in 'element' mode use the move tool to drag objects together and join them
- object is still not "water tight", use weld tool to weld vertices together
- right click 'Snap Tool'-> snaps -> "Perpendicular + Vertex" -> options -> enable axis constraints
- avoid "warped quads" as the game engine will not be able to triangulate them properly
	-> connect vertices to triangulate the "warped quad" how you like
	-> Display tab -> Untick 'Edges only' to help identify warped quads etc
- NAMING CONVENTIONS -> all lowercase with no spaces, using underscores instead

VERT MODE
'Remove' tool get rids of vertices without removing neighbouring polys
'Break' tool splits the verts into 3 separate verts, one per neighbouring poly
'Extrude' 
'Chamfer' 
'Target weld' allows you to weld two specific verts
'Remove isolated verts' eliminates verts that you may have accidentally created 

'Collapse' tool will join two verts at their centre point but will only work along edges
'Cut' will create a cut wherever you click, particularly useful when snap is active 
'MSmooth' mesh smooth, breaks things into smaller polys in order to smooth the object
'Tessellate' is similar in that it adds polys but does not smooth
'Relax' will attempt to soften corners and edges without adding extra polys 

Ctrl + A in vert mode -> 'Weld' -> ensures object is 'water tight'


EDGES
'Ring' and 'Loop 
'Chamfer' good for creating rounded corners
'Connect' good way of adding extra faces and splitting up meshes 


POLY
'Outline' is like scale but keeps the outside shape the same
'Bevel' two stage tool, like and extrude followed by tapering 
'Inset'
'Bridge' be careful using the bridge tool
'Flip' makes polys face the other direction, useful if your polys are invisible when backface culling is active 


XVIEW CHECKS
- the little plus in viewport -> open edges, face orientation, overlapping faces, multiple edges, isolated verts, overlapping verts

HAMMER TAB
Reset xform with broken mesh selected -> Reset, highlights and fixes any mathematical errors with the mesh
Go to modifiers and right click -> Collapse to apply it to the mesh

HIDING AND UNHIDING MESHES
Right click -> 'Hide unselected' 
Right click -> 'Unhide all'

CHECKING POLYS
Select an object -> Poly mode -> Selection 'By Numeric' -> Greater than 4 sides

SMOOTHING GROUPS
Faces that are touching one another will 'fake a smooth edge' if they have the same smoothing group
Faces that aren't touching can have the same smoothing group, those that are touching cannot

1/11/16
Render UV templates as TGAs -> in photoshop go to the 'Channel' tab -> Ctrl + click 'Alpha' thumbnail -> copy and paste selection onto new layer

8/11/16
Material Editor -> Utilities -> Reset all Mateirial slots (makes all materials empty)
After saving files to disc, check them on another computer to ensure there are no errors
Flatten mapping -> normalise clusters active, rotation and fill holes can be turned off
Texture shouldn't stretch over edges -> use checkerboard numbers to check -> hold shift and move edges to ensure texels aren't stretched
When scaling parts of UV mesh, make sure you scale all of the islands at the same time -> this is handy when optimising use of the UV space
Tools -> Pack UVs -> Normalise clusters and rotation on

22/11/16
In Photoshop if you have a texture you want but it is the wrong colour, you can match the colour from another image
	Image -> Adjustments -> Match Colour
Use NVIDIA Mental ray for rendering -> 800*600 TGA Renders
